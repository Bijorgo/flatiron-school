  Core Deliverables
  1. Write a preamble that lets the browser know that this document's type is HTML.
  2. Write an <html> element consisting of a <head> and <body>.
  3. Link this file to `index.js`, so that the browser loads that file **after** loading the <body>.
  (Bonus 1) Link this file to `styles.css`, and apply some styles to elements on this page.

<!-- Notes: -->
  <!-- This is a comment -->
  <!-- shortcut for comment is ctrl+/ -->
  <!-- **void** tag <![information]> like DOCTYPE does not require a closing tag -->
  <!-- syntax for tags <> opening </> closing-->
  <!-- opening tag, tag name, attribute-->
  <!-- resources: MDN (complete and up to date options), W3Schools (focused more on ease of understanding but less complete) to look up tag names and syntax -->
  <!-- open in live server, in browser localhost: port#-->

  <!-- Below: This is a preamble- tells browser to read file as HTML document -->
  <!DOCTYPE html>

  <!-- below: not a void tag b/c more info than can be contained in small tag, has an opening and closing tag -->
  <html lang="en">
      <!-- anything relevant to nearest opening and closing tags goes here -->
       <head>
        <title> An Introduction to HTML.</title>
          <!-- Shows up in tab title as well as other places determined by the browser -->
        <script defer src="./index.js"></script>
        <!--abolve links index.js file to index.html, remember src means source-->
        <!-- you can do absolute or relative path for local source, relative is more developer friendly b/c absolute path will break when shared with another machine-->
        <!-- . means directory you're currently in, / means folder index.js -this is a relative path-->
        <!-- if you were pulling from ex. end folder: "../end/index.js" ".."means go up one folder then use path-->
        <!-- "../../finishPath" is an extension from above: goes two folders up before starting written path-->
        <!-- "defer" keyword tells browser to load and read .js file only after all HTML hs been parsed-->
      </head>
        <!-- head tag contains all information NOT visible on the page, AKA metadata -->
        <!-- body tag contains all information visible on the page-->
       <body>
        <header>
          <!-- This shows up in page header as opposed to <title> in <head> -->
          <h1>An Introduction to HTML!</h1>
          <h2>Ingeborg Adolfs</h2>
            <!-- <style attribute="information"></closingSpanTag> -->
            <!-- <h2> and all higher #s show up smaller and smaller, up to the browser to do, lower numbers are read as more important to browsers -->
            <!-- can be increasingly important for acessability, screen reading, etc-->
            <!-- many tags do similar things, but it's good to be specific to impart meaning and style considerations to broswer -->
          <p>Some <span style="color:blueviolet;">styled</span> text.</p>
            <!-- <span> allows you to style within HTML. use it minimally and keep styling to CSS-->
        </header>

          <!-- image tag, src is source (a required atirbute) "link goes here"-->
